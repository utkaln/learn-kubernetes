* The code here are various templates that can run using ```kubectl``` or ```helm```. For installation and troubleshooting refer to the gist file link above
* During the learning I used the microservices demo code provided by google (gcr). The link to that gist is [here](https://gist.github.com/utkaln/19ef6d461ed5065cbe4a013329754d05). The link to code repo is [here](https://github.com/utkaln/microservices-demo/tree/release/v0.3.4). I have used v0.3.4 as by December 2021 it was recommended to use this version which has the  fix for the infamous log4j JNDI look up issue
